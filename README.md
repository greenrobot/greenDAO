Features
--------
greenDAO's unique set of features:

* Rock solid: greenDAO has been around since 2011 and is used by countless famous apps
* Super simple: concise and straight-forward API
* Small: The library is <100K and it's just plain Java jar (no CPU dependent native parts)
* Fast: Probably the fastest ORM for Android, driven by intelligent code generation
* Safe and expressive query API: QueryBuilder uses property constants to avoid typos
* Powerful joins: query across entities and even chain joins for complex relations
* Flexible property types: use custom classes or enums to represent data in your entity

Those features are already here for you to try out. Note: Documentation and test coverage may be lacking, and the API may change in the future.
### Asynchronous API
* New AsyncSession (acquired from DaoSession.startAsyncSession()) provides most operations for DAOs, Queries, and transactions in a asynchronously variant
* AsyncOperations are processed in order by a background thread
* waitForCompletion methods for AsyncSession and AsyncOperations
* AsyncOperationListener for asynchronous callback when operations complete
* Asynchronous operations can be merged in single transactions (details follow)
* Added raw SQL queries returning a Query object (LazyList support etc.)

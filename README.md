Add greenDAO to your project
----------------------------
greenDAO is available on Maven Central. Please ensure that you are using the latest versions by [checking here](http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Cg%3A%22org.greenrobot%22%20AND%20a%3A%22greendao%22) [and here](http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Cg%3A%22org.greenrobot%22%20AND%20a%3A%22greendao-generator%22)

Add the following Gradle configuration to your Android project:
```groovy
buildscript {
    repositories {
        mavenCentral()
    }
    dependencies {
        classpath 'org.greenrobot:greendao-gradle-plugin:3.1.0'
    }
}
 
apply plugin: 'org.greenrobot.greendao'
 
dependencies {
    compile 'org.greenrobot:greendao:3.1.0'
}
```

Note that this hooks up the greenDAO Gradle plugin to your build process. When you build your project, it generates classes like DaoMaster, DaoSession and DAOs.
